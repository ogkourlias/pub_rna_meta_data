# Pub_RNA_Meta_data
This repository is dedicated to the exploration and examination of publicly available RNA-Seq sample metadata.
R Scripts were used to to load and transform the metadata file containg 46,410 publicly avalable RNA-Seq sample info.
These scripts are further expanded upon to select IDs for when we want to align and genotype certain RNA-Seq samples.
